🧩 Schema Validator — Public Frontend

This is the public frontend for the Schema Validator tool — a simple and powerful web interface for managing and validating Swagger/OpenAPI endpoints.

👉 Live Demo: https://schema-validator-demo.netlify.app/

✨ Overview

Schema Validator helps developers and QA teams ensure that API schemas remain consistent and valid across environments.
It’s built to work with a separate backend service and can be easily deployed for internal tools, client projects, or public API validation dashboards.

This solution is especially valuable when working across frontend and backend teams — it automatically highlights any changes in backend schemas that might impact the frontend.
By catching these inconsistencies early, it helps teams maintain alignment, reduce debugging time, and improve overall developer productivity.

💡 Why Use Schema Validator?

Modern web apps depend on clean and consistent API contracts between backend and frontend.
When those contracts drift — even slightly — things break. Schema Validator helps you stay ahead of that.

✅ Benefits for Teams

Instant feedback when backend changes affect the frontend

Faster debugging with clear visibility into schema differences

Consistent API structure across environments and releases

Improved productivity by automating manual schema checks

Better collaboration between backend, frontend, and QA teams

Whether you’re a solo developer maintaining multiple services or part of a cross-functional team, Schema Validator ensures you always know when something changes — before it causes problems.
